### Conectar con Aws

Terraform it uses files with a .tf extension and the language used is HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language). To connect with the different providers terraform uses plugins called provider which is declared in a terraform file:

    nano provider.tf

/provider.rf

    terraform {
      required_providers {
        aws = {
          source  = "hashicorp/aws"
          version = "~> 4.0"
        }
      }
    }

    provider "aws" {}
 
The line that says provider will receive the aws account credentials through environment variables.
